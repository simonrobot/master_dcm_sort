#This code is based upon Dr Christensen's sorting and de identifying code
 But.....
 This code is completely based upon Python and Pydicom(very intitutive)
 rather than using combination of Python , bash and DCM toolkit.

# Requirements
  Python 2.7 
  Pydicom package from MIT

# AIM
  * To deidentify data based upon a text file containing Patients UID and 
    mapping name for example
    201589,Patient0001
    478569,Patient0001
    8796542,Patient0002

# Current Functionality
  * It can sort and deidentify the data.
  * For the Deidentification
    This uses Call back function.So rather writing few lines to 
    Patient's name, Physician Name, Operator name. One line does
    the trick.

# To Do
  Create logs which will report
  1. How many files were sorted
  2. How many of them were duplicates.
  3. NonDicom files and others.
